We didn’t want to miss the chance to celebrate the wonderful day. Thus, WiE Affinity Group of IEEE SB Chapter IIT Mandi in collaboration with Women’s cell IIT Mandi celebrated International Women’s day on 8 March, 2021. Due to the current pandemic it was held in hybrid mode (both in-person and online). The celebration saw various programs which included various cultural performances by females residing in the campus. It also had an amazing talk by a former college student and the Rani Gonsalves award recipient, Neha Muthiyan who gave an amazing talk encouraging all the females of the institute to do better and aim big.
                                                    The event also saw 2 Wie, IEEE speakers; one third year undergraduate at the college, Miss Nishita Sharma and another college student studying in final year, Miss Manvi Gupta. Both had enriching talks which emphasized on the fact that nothing is impossible and sited examples from their own life where they discussed situations that they thought were hard to overcome but time gave them all courage to come back with a better energy and enthusiasm. 
                                                    The event witnessed a lightning talk by the chief guest Dr Sharmila Mande, distinguished Chief Scientist, TCS Research.
                                                    
                                                    The event was a great success and was highly appreciated.
